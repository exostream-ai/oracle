Website layout and content.
The site needs to do one thing above all else: show the data immediately. No "request a demo" gates, no multi-paragraph explanation before you see anything real. The data is the pitch. Here's how I'd structure it.
Hero section. The logo on a dark background (you already have the aesthetic), a one-line description — something like "The pricing oracle for LLM inference" or "Canonical price feeds for the cost of intelligence" — and then immediately below, a live ticker strip. A horizontal scrolling bar showing 5-6 major models with their current β and θ, updating in real time. OPUS-4.5 $45.00 ↓3.1%/mo · GPT-4.1 $8.00 ↓8.0%/mo · GEMINI-2.5-PRO $10.00 ↓5.2%/mo. This is the first thing anyone sees and it immediately communicates what the product is without reading a word of copy.
Live dashboard section. Right below the hero, the full ticker board. A dark-themed table (think terminal aesthetic, consistent with the logo) showing every tracked model with: ticker, β (sync), β (batch), r_in, θ, σ, and 3M forward. Sortable by any column. This is the screenshot zone — the thing people share on X. Make it visually dense but legible. Monospace font for the numbers. Green/red for positive/negative θ. Subtle animation on price updates.
Forward curve visualizer. Click any model on the ticker board and it expands into a chart showing the forward curve — spot price declining over the 1M/3M/6M tenors. Simple line chart, dark background, clean axes. Show the decay rate θ as the slope. If you can make this interactive (hover to see exact values at any point), even better. This is the "aha moment" for anyone who understands financial instruments — they see the term structure and immediately get why this matters.
Cost calculator. A simple interactive panel. User selects a model, inputs n_in, n_out, η, and gets back: spot cost, κ (framed as "your price sensitivity"), and forward cost at 3M/6M. Add a toggle for "with Syngraph compression" that lets them input a compressed n_in and see the Δ_compress. This is the utility that keeps people coming back and the natural onramp to the API.
Historical price chart. A multi-line chart showing β over time for all tracked models (or selectable subsets). This is where the reconstructed historical data shines. Seeing GPT-4 fall from $60 to $8 on a single chart is visceral. Label the major events (model releases, price cuts) on the timeline. This chart alone will get embedded in dozens of blog posts and analyst reports.
API documentation. Clean, minimal, developer-focused. Show 3 example calls: get current spot, get forward curve, get Greek sheet. Include curl examples and SDK snippets. Emphasize that the free tier requires no API key. Link to full docs (hosted separately on a docs subdomain or a dedicated docs page).
"How it works" section. Brief — 3-4 short blocks explaining the model at a high level. Something like: "Every model has a ticker price β — the cost of output tokens at the origin provider. Structural Greeks capture the ratios (input cost, cache discounts, batch pricing). The decay rate θ measures how fast prices are falling. Forward curves project where prices are headed." Link to the full published methodology for anyone who wants the math. Don't put equations on the landing page — save those for the methodology doc.
Footer. Minimal. Links to API docs, methodology, GitHub (if you open-source anything), X account, and a small "Built by the team behind Syngraph" with a link.

What not to put on the landing page. No pricing tiers (it's free at launch). No "sign up for early access" (the product is live, let people use it). No team bios or company story (save for an About page). No lengthy explanation of why inference pricing matters — the live data makes that argument better than copy ever could. No chatbot or AI assistant widget — ironic given the product, but it would be distracting.
Aesthetic notes. The logo is white on black, so lean into a dark-mode-first design. Financial terminals are dark. Bloomberg is dark. TradingView's default is dark. This isn't just aesthetic — it signals "serious data product" rather than "SaaS landing page." Use a monospace or mono-adjacent font for numbers and tickers (JetBrains Mono, IBM Plex Mono, or similar). Use the weight contrast from the logo (bold/light) as a typographic system across the site. Minimal color — white text, maybe a single accent color for interactive elements and alerts. Green for positive movements, red for negative, keeping with financial convention.
The whole site should feel like walking up to a terminal that's already running. The data is live, the interface is immediate, and the user's first experience is seeing real numbers — not reading about them.

Visual tools for the dashboard.
This depends on whether you're building the dashboard as a standalone web app or as a React artifact that lives closer to the marketing site. Given the terminal aesthetic of the logo and the data density you need, I'd go standalone with a proper charting stack.
For the charts (price history, forward curves, θ over time): Lightweight Charts by TradingView. It's open source, purpose-built for financial time-series, and it looks exactly like what you want out of the box — dark theme, candlestick and line charts, crosshair with value readouts, responsive, performant with large datasets. It's what actual trading platforms use. The API is simple and it renders beautifully without heavy customization. This is the right tool for the historical price chart and the forward curve visualizer.
For the ticker board and Greek sheet: you don't need a charting library for tabular data. A styled HTML table with some subtle animation (number transitions on price updates, color flashes on changes) is more effective than any component library. TanStack Table (formerly React Table) if you want sorting and filtering. But honestly, a hand-rolled table with CSS grid and a monospace font will look better and feel more like a terminal. The aesthetic you want is dense, minimal, information-forward — component libraries tend to add visual noise.
For the cost calculator and interactive elements: plain React with Tailwind. No UI framework needed. Input fields, sliders for η and token counts, and computed results that update reactively. Keep it lean.
For the embeddable widget (the live ticker strip that bloggers can embed): a self-contained Web Component or a lightweight iframe. No dependencies, loads fast, works anywhere. D3 is overkill for a single-number ticker. Just styled HTML with a WebSocket or polling connection to the API.
What I'd avoid: Recharts (too basic for financial data, doesn't handle time-series well). Chart.js (similar limitations, fine for dashboards but not for financial charts). Heavy dashboard frameworks like Grafana or Metabase (wrong aesthetic, too much overhead for a bespoke product). D3 directly (powerful but the development time isn't worth it when Lightweight Charts does what you need out of the box).
The stack in summary: Lightweight Charts for financial time-series, hand-styled tables for the ticker board, plain React and Tailwind for interactivity, and a minimal Web Component for the embeddable widget. Dark theme everywhere, monospace numbers, the bold/light weight system from the logo carried through the typography. Fast, dense, terminal-feeling.
